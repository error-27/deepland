# deepland
This is a simple survival-sandbox game I'm trying to work on to learn Odin and Raylib!

I cannot promise that this will be finished. The source code will always be here though in case someone wants to look for examples, and in case someone wants to pick up the project where I leave off.

## Build
You just need to use `odin` to build/run the `src` directory. I tend to use a build directory, though, which I do with the following command:

`odin run src --out:build/deepland`

The `.gitignore` is already set up to ignore this directory, so I'd recommend using that if you want to avoid having to clean up built executables.

## Contribution
I am **NOT** accepting contributions at the moment. This is just a project for me to learn from right now. If it gets to a more finished state, I may start accepting PRs. Even if I am not accepting PRs, feel free to fork the project and mess around with it yourself though.
